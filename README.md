This drawing app is based on a school project.
The goals of this project are:

 - To port the project designed from the old Eclipse Android Plugin to Android Studio
 - To implement and adhere to Google's Material Design standards (https://www.google.com/design/spec/material-design/introduction.html)
 - To create simpler menu options for drawing and navigation
